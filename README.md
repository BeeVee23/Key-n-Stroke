This dialog is ugly. To fix this, i need a validated security certificate. Certum offers a low priced <a href="http://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml"> 1 year certificate for open source projects </a> for ‚Ç¨ 25.00 per annum. If someone funds at least three years of certification (‚Ç¨ 75.00), i will use that money to buy a new certificate each year. Then I will also implement a secure autoupdater. <a href="https://github.com/Phaiax/PxKeystrokesForScreencasts/issues/15">Get in contact with me.</a> For transparency: Currently total raised money: ‚Ç¨ 0 (May 2020). You can support via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PxKeystrokesForScreencasts">Patreon</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.me/phaiax">paypal.me/phaiax</a>, send Bitcoins (`1JWER55pheUeJzaUcqaYwP8ZaGe5C16Rp9`) or Stellar Lumens (`phaiax*keybase.io`). You can verify the wallet addresses cryptographically on <a href="https://keybase.io/phaiax">keybase.io/phaiax</a>. Add the message "pkfs" to the payment so I can associate it with this project. After funds for the next six years of developer certificates are raised (which I assume will never happen), I will use any additional funds to buy and eat icecream for myself and anyone I like.

2021-03-01: I've bought a certificate. An update is on the way.

## Releases
You can find the exe in the <code>Releases</code> folder

May 2020: There is <a href="https://github.com/Phaiax/PxKeystrokesForScreencasts/commits/devel">new version</a> in the works with support for multi monitor / multi dpi setups. It will takes a while since I need to port the app from WindowsForms to WPF and I do this in my spare time.

- v0.0.1 (Text positioning not implemented yet)
- v0.1.1 (Looks fine)
- v0.1.2 (More Whitespace between special chars)
- v0.1.3 (fix bug with Win+? shortcuts)
- v0.2.0 (indicator for cursor position, history timeout, bugfixes, documentation)
- v0.3.0 (indicator for pressed buttons, deadkey fixes, backspace functionality)
- v0.3.1 (new icons, little fixes and internal improvements)

## Requirements
Windows 8 or 10

Windows 7 requires you to change the default font, otherwise you will see little squares instead of symbols.
